So you’re excusing companies for omitting birth control based on jesus beliefs?"
"@TheRoach1776 @Lunges_n_Lashes @PPFA @AbortionStories It’s lack of access to birth control.  Why do you think you still need a prescription?  Why do companies like chick fil a and Hobby Lobby (Christian ran) purposely choose to NOT have this covered for women in their health care?"

"?I learned a lot about who I am and what I stand for, and I'm unafraid now to live unapologetically, me.\n?I endured a LOT of changes at my workplace, most of which were really bad changes, and came out stronger with a promotion and a promising future ahead."
"?I got to take a trip to Utah and Idaho to see some old furry friends, and meet a bunch of new ones for the first time ever.\n?I fell in love with and adopted my first Snake, a Royal Python named Slytherin, from Safari's Sanctuary."
"?I aquired my first brand new car after the one my parents gave me broke down at the end of 2019.\n?I started anti-depression meds in January due to a traumatic event from the previous year, and I am successfully off the medication today."
"?We raised an additional $2,500 for Safari's thru @AWOOAssociation, bringing the grand total to $3,315!\n?I celebrated 3 years of marriage with the love of my life\n?I relocated to a new house built in the 70's in Tulsa that I love to death, and can't wait to start a family in."
"?My online presence absolutely exploded. I went from an average of 3,000 profile visits/month to 2 2 5 , 0 0 0 vists/month. *WHOA.*\n?My fursuit business, @PDubCreations, donated a total of $1,315 to its charity, Safari's Sanctuary."
"2020 Reflections...\n\n?I learned a lot about people this year. Specifically, how to see warning signs of someone not to be trusted.\n?I made a LOT of new friends, and solidified relationships with the ones I already have even more."

"Hawley cites a few Democrats’ objections to electoral votes in 2004 and 2016. He neglects to mention that Congress resoundingly rejected those objections and counted the votes. Which is exactly what will happen this time."
"The only thing this objection will do is draw out the process of counting the electoral votes and force every senator to go on the record and choose between fealty to Trump or loyalty to democracy and the Constitution."
