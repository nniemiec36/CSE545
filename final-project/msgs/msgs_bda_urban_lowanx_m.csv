"@AllbrightNFL I’d also add that I agree taking time off on 2nd down. But on 3rd and goal from the 1 with a minute left, you try to score the touchdown."
"@AllbrightNFL Of course they could miss the 2 point conversion, but you’d unquestionably rather have an opportunity to be touchdown protected than up only 2 points."
"@AllbrightNFL Yes, that’d be the miracle that beats you, which is highly unlikely. As is a FG in the 19 second drive. I’d rather the opponent need to go the extra 35 yards in 40 seconds with no timeouts. Also not mentioned: Raiders had a chance to be touchdown protected by scoring."
"@AllbrightNFL Easy in hindsight, but likelihood of a TD drive from your own 25 is 17%, and that doesn’t factor in time which Miami had little of. Vegas should only stall if FG protected or can actually win with a FG. Miami needed a miracle either way. I’d rather the miracle be a TD than a FG."

"@Martentoellner @bakersimpszn @PFF Well said. That's exactly the problem"

"@SolveExistence @ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec Actually they’re not at all bent on more American influence; some elements I’ve seen want closer ties with the EU if anything; They also distrust Russia. but this is about *domestic* authoritarianism and corruption; most mass protests are. To presume it’s about us is narcissism."
"@duanekloeppleGK @ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec Doesn’t look like he has spoken out against discount-Tito, just whining about imaginary “the globalists”. Away from cameras, tens of thousands of Belarusians have suffered and died at homes and in  crummy, state-run hospitals while his elites and their kids pursue this strategy: https://t.co/bERDEIyxFi"
"@MaganeMeow @ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec Bruh there’s no “American empire” and admitting you prefer Lukashenko (who also plays up nativism/anti-Semitism) to some imaginary boogeyman you've concocted shows how crazily far-Left you've gone. Socialism has major problems; communism is a totalitarian nightmare."
"@ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec Which is CRAZY. Lockdowns clearly aren’t sustainable *long-term* but social distancing and mask mandates are vital. Opposing those doesn’t make you anti-socialist /anti-globalist, just too lazy, selfish, and anti-science to make any personal sacrifice for your own countrymen."

"@ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec I lived in Minsk for 10mo, interned with DoS (researched energy projects). Took Russian classes at a big Minsk university there, befriended students. Belarus is the least de-Sovietized economy and these are kids of corrupt elites. Most youth are protesting for something better."
"@ihatecommunist @JackPosobiec Praising Lukashenko shows you’re not really against socialism. The govt still runs 75-80% of the economy, esp farms/factories, but McDonald’s and a few others can set up shop in cities while most live in poverty. His KGB+OMON run autocratic crackdowns. Your profile pic is a sham."
