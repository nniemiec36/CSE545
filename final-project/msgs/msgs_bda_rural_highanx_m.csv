"I think that if you get someone who knows to write a decent Sci-Fi story and that can play to Whitaker’s strong points as the doctor while also strengthening the weak points you may bring a lot of people and fans back into the fold."
"At my point when I entered a lot of who fans hated moffat’s writing but I think mostly because that was based on Davies exit. The timeless child debacle does not help either."
"I know each doctor had some low point episodes but holy shit is Whitaker’s doctor bad. Not hating on the fact of a female doctor, but the writing has to be some of the worst I’ve ever seen. @bbcdoctorwho please get chibnall out of the writing team for this series."
"I came in during the last few years of Matt’s time as the doctor, but I eventually spent the summer of that year catching up on over 50 years of history. And looking at it now I find that’s it’s a disgrace for any of the newer episodes to be labeled as doctor who."
"After dusting off my #DoctorWho Blu ray sets to watch before new year’s when I look back on the series it just feels empty... since the New Years special is coming soon it just feels like people have gone to far with how the show treats its fan base."
"@N0vaLaws0n @revnagimato @bbcdoctorwho I mean capaldi was wild, but it was the first time I think new who fans had seen a more serious and cold side of the doctor during and even after the regen cycle was over. I’m willing to watch the New Years Special to give it another chance but that’s my last shot at an attempt."
"@N0vaLaws0n @revnagimato @bbcdoctorwho I mean he has a right to his own opinion. I gave multiple seasons of her time as the doctor a chance and the writing is killing it for me.

Which is a shame because people often see them as a ""generic pop group"" bcause of the little they've seen of them."
"RT @ShadowTodd: Obviously ""Dynamite"" is more significant and will do a lot more for BTS than ""Domino"" did for Jessie J. A big genuine crossover hit for BTS that people who don't care about K-Pop will know opens a lot of doors, vs. Jessie J who was always going to be an also-ran."
"RT @ShadowTodd: I took a relisten to that last BTS record and songs that didn't grab me the first time had grown on me, vs. ""Dynamite"" which was the opposite. I think I wound up on the side of still liking it in the end, but it's about a 6/10 for me."

"Watch your laboring person closely. If you notice tension, help them relax.\n\nMost of the time, the more they can relax and surrender to the process, the easier and quicker it will go."
"Patient advocates are available at all hospitals. If you feel as though something is off, trust your intuition and ask to speak with one. Remember: the hospital staff, including your doctor, work for YOU."
"In a normal, low risk pregnancy, use the 4-1-1 rule when deciding when to go to the hospital.\n\nWhen contractions are coming every 4-5 minutes, lasting 1 min long and have been for 1 hour.\n\nRemember, subsequent labors usually go faster."
"When to call the doctor:\n\n- Signs of premature (before 37 weeks) labor\n\n- Leaking or a gush of fluid from the vagina\n\n- When contractions are becoming longer, stronger & closer\n\n- If you have questions or concerns\n\nNEVER feel bad about calling your doctor"
"2nd stage contractions are different and may not be painful or may be so in a different way. \n\nYou'll welcome the change of pace. Things are moving along!"
"It’s considered good luck for baby to be born in the caul, which means with the sac and waters still in tact. \n\nBack in the day, they would take the umbilical cords of these babies, dry them and sell them to sailors as a good luck token. How cool is that?!"
"Early contractions may last anywhere from 30-40 seconds and come around every 5-20 minutes. \n\nThese are usually painless and can last for days. This is pre-labor. \n\nDistract yourself with cleaning, chores, cooking or some other project but try not to burn all of your energy."
"“What’s a doula?” is the number one response I get when I mention doulas and doula work. No hard feelings. A few years ago, I didn’t know either.\n\nIn a nutshell, Doula’s help expecting parents navigate the world of pregnancy, birth and postpartum.\n\nhttps://t.co/aOapstsC7o"
"If labor goes on for days (yes this is common) a mother may feel:\n\n- Discouraged\n\n- Frustrated\n\n- Fatigued\n\n- Anxious or doubtful of her abilities to continue\n\n- Worried\n\nBe sure to pay attention to her needs & encourage / reassure her when needed."
"A warm compress on the perineum during the birthing stage can relieve pain, help relaxation and provide comfort."
