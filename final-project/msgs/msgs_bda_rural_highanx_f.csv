"@RoryCambridge0 Not to mention the additional trauma to the children if they witness their pet being harmed."
"@RoryCambridge0 I worry for the people and children but the animals many times are the most vulnerable because the ones that get violent can kill them with little to no repercussions so many will direct that physical abuse towards the family pet."
"@RoryCambridge0 Someone had their cat kicked hard, a dog was choked, and another tried to throw the child’s cat down the stairs. These animals shouldn’t have to endure this."
"get out to do it or make sure they are given to a safe home and tell the abuser they go out and ran away. Please don’t make an innocent animal be forced to stay and be harmed or killed. 3 people have had their pets harmed this week that I’ve talked to."
"If you can’t leave or choose to stay in an abusive relationship, you do what you have to do. But if there are pets being harmed/tortured by the abuser they don’t have the choice to run away. Arrange for a neighbor or friend to drop them off at a shelter or rescue if you can’t"
"@HeSays2me Please please please get rid of the dog. It’s completely unfair to have an innocent animal abused that doesn’t have the choice to run away. Tell him the dog got loose and ran off but please save the dog."
"@HeSays2me PLEASE GET RID OF THE DOG. The dog has no option of escape so please do the right thing and drop it off at shelter or sanctuary before he kills it."
