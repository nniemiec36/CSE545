"But then I'm a very pro nukes guy, more the marrier for me when it comes to nuclear weapons states."
"This is a a very cursory look about what may happen IF Iran goes nuclear. Which itself is a hypothetical possibility albeit something I'm expecting to become reality by end of this decade.\nSo would this be good or bad for India. If you ask me I'll say good."
"2nd India imports most of her oil from that region, it is also a major supplier of remittance dollars for India. Though we don't like to admit it we are a remittance economy. Having 2 countries going eyeballs to eyeballs and armed with nukes is a scenario we are familiar with."
"And that won't be good for India because 1)it'll overnight solve Pakistan's perennial financial crisis + plenty left over for major jump in defense spending.\nAnd whenever Pakistan has received no question asked support from other countries it has amped up it's campaign of terror"
"Saudi have no nuclear umbrella. If they have to make good their threat to get nuclear weapons they'll have to basically buy it on turnkey basis.\nOnly Pakistan sells such services, and it will demand an diplomatic blank cheque against India and a very big fee for that."
"Both Turkey & Saudi Arabia hate each other, but they both hate Iran even more. Turks have defacto NATO nuclear umbrella but it is targeted at Russia and Americans may not want to get involved in another Middle East kerfuffle in which nukes may be used."
"I don't expect Iran funding terrorism in India but expect more arrogant diplomatic stance than what we're used to in past.\nBoth Turks & Saudis have said they'll match any Iranian nuclear arsenal. And Pakistan is 1st country they'll go to get their bomb."
"Good thing for India is they hate each other equally sincerely, it is every bit as inherited as their hatred of Hindu India. So nuclear Iran would kind of distract Turks a lot, I mean really a lot.\nNow not so good things about nuclear Iran.\nWell for one Iran isn't India's friend"
"Nuclear Iran also put temporary break on inexorable Turkish march southwards. I'm 100% sure Turks would be involved in future confrontation between Pakistan and India. Just part pathological hatred Muslims have for India, that's in their blood."
"However new nuclear weapons state have a habit of picking fights that they regret later + Iran is not going to give Pakistan a free run in Afghanistan.\nNuclear Iran would also puncture Pakistani rallying cry of being only Islamic nuclear weapons state, a source of much pride."

"I solve  human puzzles. When I’m talking to someone, I’m doing my best to make sense of what they’re saying and doing. I believe the best way to do that is to know what they’re thinking while they’re saying whatever it is they’re saying. That usually helps solve the human puzzle."
"I think one reason I’ve survived as long as I have doing the risky stuff I do is that I don’t initiate unless there’s clear present danger. I know what to say when someone calls me. I tell them what I think is right and wrong in response to their need. What they do is up to them."
"Police have no choice but to respond to every call they get. How they respond depends on a set of written rules to help them do their jobs (respond to crises) and still protect themselves as much as possible. I respond to calls also, but I follow my own set of rules. Am I a hero?"
"I look at every situation I find myself in as a test. My job is to come up with the way to get an A+ on the test. So far I’ve survived all the tests I’ve faced, but some I’ve done poorly on and had to think about a lot before I could know how I might have improved my lower grade."
"I often stop watching a movie or TV series once I know how the scriptwriter thinks. Then I decide whether I want to watch it any more. My liking or disliking the scriptwriter’s message often decides if I’m going to continue watching the rest. I’ve stopped watching a lot of shows."
"Pelosi nailed Trump when she said all he wants is checks signed by him going out to everyone. His recent behavior makes sense if that is his goal. If Congress doesn’t pass more money going out to the average person, he can say he wanted it to. If it does pass, he gets the credit."
"My high success rate is primarily due to the power others project on to me. I understand how projection works (my dissertation was on paranoia). You cannot become a bully unless you introjected a bully from your past. You become the bully because s/he has the power and you don’t."
"The fact that my prediction yesterday was accurate may be surprising to some people. I am not Cassandra, but I do know how people think, and that knowledge can often predict future behavior. Another good predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Maybe I’m not a witch doctor."
"I predict Trump will sign the bill now before him at a time and place that will get him the best audience. I predict he’ll also have a few things to say. We’ll see if I’m inside his head or not."
"If believing something to be true that isn’t true (being delusional) is crazy, then we’re all crazy. I’ve never met anyone that didn’t have at least one delusion. If your delusion gives you permission to hurt others or yourself unnecessarily, then you meet my definition of crazy."

"RT @garyblack00: I am holding my $TSLA $830 PT.  That said, many TSLA catalysts are front loaded in 2021, and TSLA should move past $700 in the next 30-60 days, as TSLA’s FY’21 volume guide, Biden EV focus, CyTruck update, launch of FSD MRR, and $8T active mgrs building $TSLA positions take hold."
"RT @garyblack00: Why $TSLA will likely go to $800.\n1/ Given long EV runway - 3% adoption today going to 20% by 2025 - and holding TSLA’s current 25% EV share, I can easily get to 2025 EPS of $24, attach a P/E ratio of 50x, and get 2025 value of $1200. At a 9.5% disct rt, TSLA is worth $830 today."
"@garyblack00 He rolled the dice and it looks like he’s losing"
"RT @garyblack00: I had a two-day email exchange with a guy I used to work with who now runs a $600M hedge fund and shorted $TSLA at $600.  He’s now kicking himself as $TSLA approaches $700.  Amazingly:\n\n1/ He’s a value investor who doesn’t own growth stocks, but thinks he can short growth stocks."
"RT @realMikeLindell: We must confiscate all the Dominion machines as a matter of national security! @realDonaldTrump will be proven to have won the election in a landslide! https://t.co/mTofWUfBu4"
"RT @garyblack00: Seems like whenever I call something going vertical way overpriced - $NKLA, $KODK, $BYND - people say I don’t understand it and I should stick to $TSLA. With $NKLA @ $14 and headed toward $0, I’m sure those holding NKLA wish they’d sold when I said $NKLA was a short @ $60."
"RT @garyblack00: 5/ Contrary to media reports and analysts who rigidly value $TSLA as an auto stock, $TSLA is not expensive on most valuation metrics. No ptf mgr values growth stocks on current yr earnings. TSLA trades at 69x FY’22 EPS, or 1.2x 5-yr forward EPS growth of 57%. Only $FB is cheaper."
"RT @garyblack00: 4/ My $TSLA $830 PT in 6-12 mos assumes 2025 global EV adoption of 20%, and TSLA takes 25% EV share. By 2025, I expect TSLA to deliver 4M vehicles, producing $24 EPS. If data comes out that EV adoption is likely to grow to 30% by 2025 (1.5x), my 6-12 mo PT would be $1,245 (1.5x). https://t.co/KTHfGnxAKg"
"RT @garyblack00: 3/ For $TSLA to move higher, three key metrics - EV adoption, $TSLA EV share, auto gross margins - have to beat expectations.  Biden’s EV plan could signif accelerate EV adoption. Model Y global expansion, mfg capacity doubling, and CyTruck could sharply increase TSLA EV share."
"RT @garyblack00: 2/ $TSLA stock rose 669% YTD because Model Y launched globally, Shanghai opened, and Berlin/Austin are doubling capacity. This caused forward EPS ests to soar, which pushed TSLA sharply higher. S&P inclusion and TSLA’s 5:1 stock split served as catalysts to highlight TSLA value."

"@wayne_rays @benshapiro @MattWalshBlog There’s ALWAYS an error in reporting! Usually it’s intentional. Our “free press” does not at all resemble what it was supposed to, much like congress."
"@its_Los98 @CandyPlaysPC @jimbri66 @FOX5Atlanta I think the evidence would not be concrete, but rather paper.  And yes, it should all have been verified, but by who, the people who put the boxes of ballots under the table until members of the other party were gone so that the democrats could “verify” the ballots unopposed?"

"@walt48184812 @BreitbartNews Do you REALLY believe that? Maybe you just want to.

The actual vote count was just an additional crime."

"@mrpudge89 @EnderFPE @sparkobuzzer @FOX5Atlanta I guess videos of the vote counting being closed, poll watchers leaving the building, then election workers pulling out suit cases of concealed ballots from under the tables, that’s not actual evidence of 2020 election corruption? Silly us!"

"My point is not to say that this is the proper solution. My point is to say that our government is failing us. You blame the wealthy, but in actuality, it wouldn’t take much of the thousands that they take from our paychecks to fix this."
"If every voter in this presidential election committed to 7 bucks a month, then all homeless could be housed at a rate of 2k per month per person. This doesn’t account for families that could live together either."
"Keep in mind this is assuming that those numbers of homeless are accurate (sure there will be some level of error) and assuming that only 50% of Biden voters would contribute and no one else."
"Expanded nationwide: Same 50% used for Biden voters. 40.64 million. 585k homeless in US. Same 2k rent (majority of places nowhere near that high). That’s 29 per month per person to house all homeless."
"Keep seeing people blame one thing or another, so I did a little math. Let’s assume that 50% of Biden voters in CA believe in socialism and can afford it. That’s 5.5m people. 151k homeless there. Lets say 2k rent. That’s 54 bucks per month to house all homeless individuals."
