"@SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC I can see by some of your posts that you’re likely not interested in caring about others and are only fighting for your right to openly mock and dehumanize others. So I’m going to bow out of this now. Please consider that words do have consequences and we should choose carefully."
"@SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC But if someone tells you that language you use is harmful to them and you continue to use it, you are speaking to harm. I understand that it can feel overwhelming and ridiculous even. But we should listen to the concerns of others. Not just dismiss it as “I’m offended culture”"
"@Ravenrider2020 @SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC We are responsible for the language we use and the consequences that come from it, whether intentional or not. It’s up to each of us to listen to those around us and adapt our language to better communicate and connect. Or choose not to and accept whatever consequences come."
"@SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC There are of course going to be situations you can’t expect, but if an entire group of people tells you that a word is offensive or harmful to them, the people that are not part of that group should also try to be respectful and take responsibility for the harm they can cause."
"@SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC I don’t think it’s annoying to tell people that their language had consequences.  The words we use have meanings and up to us to work and create a community where our language isn’t harmful to each other as best we can."
"@Barntrash @SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC Merry Christmas is no more offensive than Happy Holidays. It doesn’t hurt anyone to recognize that there are other religions and cultural celebrations around the same time of year. You can say Merry Christmas. But don’t be upset if someone doesn’t say it back."
"@GirlJville @SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC But part of our responsibility as citizens of the same community is to listen to our neighbors and hear what is hurting them regardless of whether it hurts your or not."
"@SunkissdSLP @JesseKellyDC How about we all take some responsibility for how our words and actions impact other people? I can say that something is offensive and still take responsibility for my own actions and the consequences."

"@satxtm @Phil_Mattingly If 230 got repealed, platforms would have no choice but to kick Trump off the platforms. Would not survive being liable for Trump’s lies.
