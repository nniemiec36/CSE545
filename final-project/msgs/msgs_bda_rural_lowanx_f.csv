"RT @JoelOsteen: The enemy wouldn’t have wasted so much time and energy on you if there wasn’t something amazing in front of you. Don’t complain about what didn’t work out. God is still working. He’ll make up for what was unfair. He’ll pay you back for the wrongs."
"RT @JoelOsteen: Many of the challenges you’ve faced—the things that don’t seem fair, the obstacles that came out of nowhere, the people that turned on you—are because there’s a history maker in you. You may not see it yet, but even the enemy can see that there’s greatness in you."

"RT @JoelOsteen: God is going to get you to where you’re supposed to be. That desert is not your destiny. That barren place, the disappointment, the loss is not how your story ends. The desert is temporary; the trouble is temporary; the depression is only temporary."
"RT @JoelOsteen: God is about to do a new thing. You’re asking for the possible; God is going to do the impossible. You’re believing for the ordinary; God is going to do the extraordinary. He’s going to take you where you’ve never been."
